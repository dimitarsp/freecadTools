# freecadTools
a series of tools, settings, and extensions for improving freecad for architectural workflows

I will be gathering ideas about possible tools 

## Freecad deep Unclone tool

A tool that can copy and replicate elements


## Replace element with dependents

If you would like to swap out one architectural element within a nested tree for a nother and copy all the objects additions and subtractions for another one
